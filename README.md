This repo originall intended to host only my answers to the exercies for the
book by Sutton & Barton, Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction

A free pdf can be
found [here](http://people.inf.elte.hu/lorincz/Files/RL_2006/SuttonBook.pdf)

But now examples of common supervised/unsupervised learning models will also be
put here, in the `supervised` & `unsupervised` directories
