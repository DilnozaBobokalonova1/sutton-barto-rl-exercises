**Goal** of notebooks in this directory:

Use jupyter to explain **my understanding** of and **implement** algorithms from
Andrew Ng's course [CS299](http://cs229.stanford.edu/syllabus.html) and
**demonstrate** the working of the implemented algorithms with toy examples.

The three key elements are

1. Understand
2. Implement
3. Demonstrate

Progress may not be added in order.
